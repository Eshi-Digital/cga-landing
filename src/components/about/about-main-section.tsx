      Commercial Graduates Association (formerly Commercial School Graduates
      Association) is the oldest professional association in Ethiopia. It was
      formed in 1942 (E.C) by visionary ingenious youth thinking of fifteen,
      1941 (E.C) graduates, who out of shared desire, agreed to maintain their
      school friendship after graduation. They saw the need to establish
      periodic gathering to keep the bondage of their friendship. The idea of
      forming an association was further nurtured by the school director, Dr.
      William Naguib Nashed, who advised the group to make the association an
      all-embracing one so that subsequent graduates can join it.The Association
      began its service in a rented house near the Armenian Church at Arat Kilo.
      In 1954 it moved to its current site, behind Mega Building on Bole Road by
      purchasing land and constructing its own building. The Associationâ€™s
      current building was inaugurated by His Imperial Majesty Haile Selassie I
      in 1961 (E.C) who also graciously made a donation of Birr30,000.00 towards
      the construction cost. In 2000 (E.C) the leadership of CGA initiated a
      construction work that includes the GYM and spa center on the ground floor
      and mini hall and offices on the top floor. The total cost which was 2
      million Birr was covered by contributions from members and donations from
      organizations. The Social Club (Edir) of members took the startup in the
      donation. At present CGA houses an all purpose hall, a modern gymnasium &
      spa center, fully organized tennis play grounds and various in-door games.
      The Association, later on adopted a policy to embrace business
      professionals as members without reference to the school they obtained
      their training from. This way it kept on encouraging on coming graduates
      to join the Association and enjoy the friendship, professional activities
      and entertainment programs. CGA is one of the pioneering professional
      associations which continued in existence for more than 66 years thanks to
      the founders and senior members, the dedicated directors of the Commercial
      School, Dr. William Naguib Nashed and Ato Seifu Felleke and those who time
      and again assumed the leadership role and extended their untiring services
      towards the growth of the Association. Currently the Association has a
      little over 250 active full members and 100 associate and honorary
      members.
